42,18545,Developing Hack-Proof Software for Unmanned and Robotics Systems,"Software today controls numerous critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles. Cyber-attacks could turn these vehicles into killer machines. The security of a computer system depends on its foundations: its operating system, and the compilers and libraries used to build its software. Given that some of the modules might be available only in binary form, we would also explore ways to harden these via binary rewriters. In addition, classical techniques such as Multi-Level Security (MLS) can be used to harden unmanned and robotics systems to limit the damage suffered during an external attack. In future unmanned/robotics systems, we also envision significant use of 5G wireless technologies, which may impact the security of these systems.

In this project the student can choose to focus on: (I) evaluating the correctness of binary programs that have been hardened by binary rewriters,
(ii) developing secure solutions for autonomous systems (eg, AV), using secure foundations such as verified OSes and libraries, and/or MLS separation techniques, and

44,18548,Evaluating Wireless Security in a Post-COVID-19 World,"By the march of technology, devices are becoming ever more networked wirelessly, so as to leverage on network advantages, for exciting new vistas in IoT, personal area network and smart city designs. Accelerated by the COVID-19 outbreak, wireless technology adoption does help reduce unnecessary human-to-human touch, and these facilitate work-from-home and contactless transactions. New wireless standards or newer versions are getting released (eg. WiFi, Bluetooth LE, DSRC, RDS, Zigbee, LoRA, etc), and devices supporting these are being shipped. But software bugs are commonplace.  Technical standards themselves are not perfect, taking several versions to get them right. Certain protocols are proprietary, and they often depend on security by obscurity. Unfortunately, malicious hackers do not rest. When not implemented securely, these wireless avenues can be exploited by a hacker to gain access and remotely control the device and even other systems it is networked to. In view of the trends, it is useful to investigate into the newer and less-studied wireless technologies, and even look at older wireless technologies with newer tools.


The project objectives are: to review a wireless protocol or standard selected after discussion and its security mechanisms, obtain such wireless traffic for study, analyse the cybersecurity vulnerabilities for a use case of the wireless technology in a particular implementation and configuration, using manual and automated analysis techniques – eg. using emulator, using software composition analysis, fuzzing, etc. The student could look into the different processing involved in a communication system, how to make sense of the signal and protocol involved, and develop tools to interact with the system over-the-air. In terms of learning by doing, the steps would typically include: literature study, setup, installation, scripting/programming, experimentation, prototyping, and debugging. Through this project, the student would be able to learn valuable up-to-date cybersecurity skills.

This capability makes them useful for time critical applications such as aircraft surveillance over a congested airspace and even radar imaging of natural disasters as they unfold from space. 

Due to advancements in radio frequency electronics and improvements in computational capabilities, scientists and engineers are finding new use cases for radars. For example, miniaturized radar sensors are increasing used as sense-and-avoid sensors for autonomous cars. Man-portable radar sensors are being developed to protect military installations from human and even drones intrusion. Today, we can even use our cellphone or Wi-Fi signals as a radar signal through clever signal processing.

Students will have the opportunity to be guided by our radar team to explore novel applications of radar. After discussion with our radar team, the student can select and customise one of the following topics: (i) develop and test a """"passive"""" radar that exploits signals of opportunity (such as cellphone and Wi-Fi) for target detection, (ii) develop and test radars for sense-and-avoid or detecting targets in urban areas, (iii) exploring novel radar concepts such as producing optical-like images using radar or operating multiple radars in synchrony to obtain 3D images.

Students will be familiarized with the radar theory including classical radar signal processing chain , radar wave propagation, detection theory and localization of targets.
Depending on the project, students will also be exposed to radar hardware and circuitry.  Finally, students will be able to gain a better  understanding of digital signal processing in the field of radar work.

74,18586, Imagery Capture Device Identification,"An important component of digital media forensics is confirming the source of an image by the specific capture device (make, model and even IMEI) that captured it. In this project, we will investigate a variety of traditional and machine learning (ML) techniques focusing on identifying images from smartphone images captured from various devices as well as from a variety of social media sources (e.g. Twitter, FB, IG, Flickr) 

Unlike traditional image processing and computer vision problems, image device identification seek to extract forensic fingerprints that positively identify the device regardless of the image content/scene or environment. This remains a challenging task as robust forensic features that go beyond the pixel intensities and layouts are often: 1) weak, 2) corrupted through social media compressions and 3) tampered and/or missing.

In the first phase of this project, the student will perform a literature survey of the traditional and ML techniques common for extracting forensics fingerprints necessary to enable device identification. At the same time, the student will work on extending current device identification datasets for the specific case of smartphones, including sources from social media as well. 

 In the second part of this project, from the literature survey, the student will apply two selected techniques – traditional and ML-based – over the expanded dataset and perform a first analysis of their performance and shortcomings. Given these findings, the student will work on integrating robust feature extraction techniques meant to find weak signatures in images and apply them on the final selected approach. A project report detailing the approach, results and recommendations would be expected from the student.

This project involved OpenTAP for fast and easy development and execution of automated tests. It is built with simplicity, scalability, and speed in mind, and is based on an extendable architecture that leverages .NET Core. It offers a range of sequencing functionality and infrastructure that makes it possible for engineers to quickly develop plugins tailored for their automation needs – plugins that can also be shared with the OpenTAP community through the OpenTAP package repository. 
 
Project calls for building an analytics/telemetry system for Test Automation software KS8400A (+ Dashboard) We want to look to provide a more advanced system built into OpenTAP (Number of instances, number of tests, average test time, etc). This would be fully opensource as far as what is being done, and then we would have a live, cloud hosted dashboard to share the results with the entire OpenTAP community

Within Keysight, we want to help engineers create professional looking UIs outside of UI Experts. Ideally, we could have some type of focused toolbox allowing for a drag and drop “no-code” UI creation.

Project - Automated Calibration Systems

Topic: 
Workflow Process Improvement

Problem scenario:
Currently how tools/jigs/equipment are being tracked for maintenance/verification/calibration/loan is extremely manual and subjected to human error.
A few such errors are mis-keyed information, lapse of entry and misplaced if equipment.
Only recently have we relied on a system (windows task scheduler) to dish our reminders for calibration due dates, however this is not a long term solution. (Tracking the location of the equipment are still very manual)

Problem example: (identify the areas that human errors will occur)
A jig is required to undergo maintenance after every 2 months. A reminder is sent out via “windows task scheduler”. 
Engineering Support (ES) team is notified after searching for the jig, it is sent for maintenance. 
Now it is updated manually in SharePoint the next due date for the jig’s maintenance.

Questions:
1.	How do we approach to try and fully automate this entire process?
2.	Systems to set in place to prevent human error without adding additional workload?

Polybee is building autonomous drone solutions for pollination in indoor greenhouse farming. We have developed a novel patent-pending method of pollination with drones called Aerodynamically Controlled Pollination. This is a bio-inspired approach; the turbulent wake of drones is optimizes to vibrate the flowers at just right frequencies, much like the bumblebees when they buzz-pollinate. With this method, we can pollinate tomatoes and strawberries: the biggest crops in the greenhouse sector.

In this project, you will be involved in automation of drones in greenhouses, and liaise with our computer vision and software development teams. You will build and test an autonomous drone for flight in close proximity of crops. This will involve working on the following sub-systems:

1. State estimation:
You will be exploring different strategies for indoor pose estimation such as V-SLAM. This will also involve tuning Kalman state estimator for optimal performance. 

2. Perception of the greenhouse environment
You will work closely with the computer vision team to integrate a perception pipeline for collision avoidance and flower detection. The perception sensors could either be onboard or placed at regular intervals within the indoor space. 

3. Motion planning for efficient pollination
This involves running simulations on ROS to determine optimal motion planning strategies and algorithms. This will be the last stage in the development to maximize the number of flowers pollinated per unit time. You will be involved in iterating novel deep reinforcement learning based control strategies.

227,18963,Junior Software Engineer ,"Today, work is designed to get things done. In the future, OnLoop envisions a world where work is designed to help individuals and teams get better (while getting things done). We're on a mission to build a less biased and more productive world through the deliberate day to day development of teams. We are looking for a passionate Junior Software Engineer to join us for a full time internship.
Reach out to Monisha, our Chief Of Staff at monisha@onloop.io with your resume if you're interested and keen to know more.

Who Are We?
OnLoop is a multi-platform app for teams that builds the habit of reflection, feedback and learning to help everyone develop superpowers (and overcome blindspots). Through personalised, data-driven learning and cutting-edge, AI-powered analysis, OnLoop aims to build a less biased and more productive workplace culture. Founded in April 2020, we raised a $2m seed round by November—all within six months of writing the first line of code.

The Problem we are Solving
Given the lack of purpose-built technology and the numerous tools developed with an HR-first mindset, managers like our founders have struggled to bring out the best in their people. Think of a world prior to Zoom, Slack and Microsoft Teams. For managers developing their teams, that is the world today. Not great.
The intention exists, the time doesn’t. We’ve been there. The shift to a distributed workplace has only made the pain significantly more acute. We are taking the very best in habit forming and productivity tooling to apply it to an age old problem: feedback and learning loops.

Who are Our Customers?
OnLoop is a bottoms-up SaaS company and we aim to solve the end user pain, i.e. managers and org leaders of high performing and development focused teams around the world across industries like tech, retail, healthcare, consulting, etc in various stages of growth; start-ups or MNCs. Our pilots range across companies like Snap, H&M, Uber and Google.

Our World Class Team
Our engineering org is Singapore HQ-ed with a team that is distributed across Toronto, New York, London, Mexico City and Manila. As our founders rose through the ranks at Uber and Google among other places, you can expect a Western start-up culture with a highly diverse team across race and gender. Even with our current team of twenty-six as of June 2021, sixteen are women--extremely rare for a tech start- up in Singapore! 

There are no official work hours, no fixed leave policy. We bring our whole selves to work, we are mission and team first, we work hard, and we care about the impact we make. We are launching pilots every day. We have cash in the bank, very happy enterprise customers and are heads down in build mode.

Come join a global, highly mission-driven team to bring our vision to life!

About internship job description:
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have the potential to increase efficiency of energy provision and industrial production, and hence possess great emissions reduction potential. This potential increases further when CPS are combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI). The World Avatar project intends to support this by representing every aspect of the real world in a digital ""avatar"" world. This is being realised through a comprehensive virtualisation of entities as well as connectivity to real-time data such that the digital world remains up to date and that analyses based on the data remain self-consistent. Through an ontological representation of data in a knowledge-graph in combination with an eco-system of autonomously operating AI agents, interoperability and automation in complex decarbonisation process can be achieved. In particular, we are interested in developing energy and grid models to investigate the transformation of global energy systems with CPS.
The individual will work with an interdisciplinary and multi-national team, comprised of researchers from around the world. The individual will also learn how to: 
1. Acquire and process data; 
2. Develop ontology for the acquired data; 
3. Instantiate semantic representations of the acquired data. 

Internship competencies and requirements:
• Willingness to acquire software skills and knowledge about Semantic Web technology and knowledge graph. 
• Experience with or willingness to learn general-purpose programming languages such as Java, Python, JavaScript, C/C++. Training will be provided for those without programming background.

As a drive in this direction and to assist the site achieve these goals, a low-cost, safe and qualified Digital Twin approach would be pursued. A Digital Twin in brief is a simulated representation of physical plant assets and underlying chemical/physical processes within them (i.e. chemical reactions, separation processes, heat transfer, process equipment, instrumentation and controls). It understands, troubleshoots, predicts and optimizes performance to achieve improved business outcomes.

Project scope

For this project, key product processes will be chosen as a test-bed to build a digital twin, and the aim would be for the model to closely resemble the real unit on site. The model would be reconciled with the plant data to closely mimic the actual operating unit operation on site, literally acting as a live (or offline) Twin. The twin model will be validated with plant data (static and dynamic data), optimized and examined for process control studies to minimize variability in the outputs (Critical Quality Attributes or CQAs).
Learning outcome

The Twin if successful can also support as a key validation tool to facilitate safe, low-cost testing of change orders and help run unit/plant close to optimal solutions. The twin model if desired can be tasked to connect with live plant data and used for monitoring and quality adherence tasks.

About Us

The Software Practice is a technology development firm that builds software for clients and its own business. Our core strength is in developing large and complex web and mobile applications by architecting and implementing robust, scalable and performant software.
We started our firm working with entrepreneurs who brought expertise in specific industry verticals but required a technical team that could help them realise their product ideas. We partnered with them as their product teams helping them build their MVP, talk to customers and refine the product, raise money, and even hire their in-house tech teams while remaining as consultants. 
  
Now, our work spans across both public and private sectors where we've done several CTO-for-hire and product-team-for-hire gigs for entrepreneurs and enterprises looking to move fast. Our clients range from small start-ups looking to build and launch their product from scratch, to large enterprises (e.g. Government Agencies in Singapore such as DSTA, NEA, A*STAR and PUB) requiring innovative solutions in critical business workflows. Our enterprise clientele includes some of the largest SE Asian banks, Fortune 500 IT firms and one of Asia’s largest airports. 

Our culture is results-driven that values execution and creativity. You'll get a lot of ownership over your deliverables, and we trust you to ship high quality products on time. You will be part of a high performing cross functional team where you get to witness the direct impact of your work - seeing applications go live and seeing real-world usage.

336,19377,[A*STAR Research Internship Award] Motion planning for optimized robot trajectories,"Optimal motion planning is a classical problem in robotics and remains an active research topic. Following recent trends of flexible manufacturing, robot trajectories can no longer be fine-tuned offline, and must be computed on-the-fly based inputs from various sensors, e.g. 2D and 3D cameras. In case of collaborative or mobile robots, the system must also be able to react to changes in the environment. In this project, we aim to develop algorithms for computing optimal, collision-free trajectories for the robot based on sensor inputs.

More and more people make new friends online via social network applications such as Tinder, Facebook. Typically, these companies collect user’s particulars (hobby, education, job, etc.) and find the best matches for the user. However, it may not be a good idea to delegate such highly sensitive personal information to these companies, as data breaches due to poor data management or external hackers are reported in news from time to time. The increasing public awareness of privacy and information rights has encouraged the research community to pay more and more attention to privacy-enhancing technologies.

Privacy continues to be the most important aspect of data sharing as an increasing number of consumers are growing concerned about their privacy and the security of their personal information. 

This project aims to explore the effective solution to generate synthetic data for sharing with differential privacy protection. Specifically, we utilize some statistical-based method or GAN network to train a generative model which can be used to sample some synthetic data, which is not associated with a particular identity. Some noise needs to be added to the generative model training process to enhance privacy, while ensuring the data utility. The tasks of the project include:

1.Design the data synthesis algorithm that captures the structure and the dependency of the original dataset. 
2.Explore efficient differential privacy solutions to perturb the statistics while without sacrificing the utility too much.

Despite the significant improvements in FPGA Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools (e.g., Quartus Prime, Xilinx Vivado), mapping large applications on to modern FPGAs still involves considerable amount of design expertise and effort. Moreover, the mapping process often consumes hours of compilation time and yet produces mapping solutions with degraded quality. 

As a solution, researchers in NTU have developed tools to map large applications onto modern multi-million gate FPGAs, efficiently and effectively. Their current effort focuses on integrating these tools into commercial CAD flow. Candidates who are interested in joining this timely effort, are welcome to apply.

425,19562,Hardware-assisted Malware Detection,"Malware applications are a major threat to computing systems today. Software-based malware detection techniques rely on large malware signature database that needs to be constantly updated. As such, they are ineffective in detecting new malware or specially crafted malicious exploits that bypass the detection. In addition, stringent computation and storage capacity in typical embedded systems makes software detection techniques unappealing due to their large overhead. To overcome the drawbacks of software-based detection, researchers in NTU have developed malware detection techniques using a special type of processor registers called Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). 
The goal in this project is to develop lightweight hardware assisted malware detection for embedded autonomous vehicle systems. The candidate is expected to exploit HPCs, which are available in most of the modern processors (e.g., ARM), to monitor the application execution on the embedded system and detect the presence of malicious behavior.

436,19681,Person Re-Identification,"Person re-identification (or person re-id for short) is defined as the problem of matching images of people across disjoint camera views in a multi-camera system. It is useful for several public security applications, such as an intelligent camera surveillance system. In a typical real-world application, one single or a watchlist of a handful of known people is provided as the target set for searching through a large volume of video surveillance footage where the people on the watchlist are likely to re-appear. To further reduce the search scope among candidate cameras, an Intra-camera tracking algorithm capable of knowing where the person is heading is needed.  However, in some special events (e.g., sports events) and locations (e.g., central business district), most pedestrians may wear similar clothes such as sports uniforms and business suits. Re-identifying a person from a large crowd with similar clothing is a challenging problem.  Another challenging problem is to re-identify the same person at different times in different attire.

In this project, the applicant will use a game engine to generate people wearing similar clothing such as police and army uniforms.  The applicant will be working on deploying some of our deep learning techniques on PyTorch or Tensorflow and the development of a web demo for demonstration.  Experience in programming using Python will be necessary, and prior knowledge of PyTorch and Tensorflow would be advantageous.",Rapid-Rich Object Search Lab,"ROSE Lab, School of EEE / 50 Nanyang Ave, S2-B4b-13,, Singapore, Singapore, 639798, SINGAPORE",1,Please ensure that you attach a copy of your C.V. with your application.,"Experience in programming using Python will be necessary, and prior knowledge of PyTorch and Tensorflow would be advantageous.",2022-01-10T00:00:00,2022-05-28T23:59:00,2021-08-25T00:00:00,2021-08-31T23:59:00,1000.0,1000.0,SGD

Project scope:

In recent times, Adversarial AI researchers have developed novel ways of injecting pixel-level perturbations to images, thereby fooling state-of-the-art deep learning models in the field of Computer Vision. There is a need to ensure that these models are not only highly accurate, but also robust against adversaries.

This project will look into building experiments that can aid in attempting to measure how robust a Computer Vision model is, and also provide the understanding of how existing methods like adversarial retraining can improve robustness of these models.

There are 2 parts to this project which the student will be doing:
1. Perform adversarial retraining, which involves generation of adversarial examples and re-pipe them into a training pipeline for the model. Conduct testing to measure accuracy and robustness before and after retraining. Assess robustness of different adversarial example generation methods.
2. Develop a robustness measurement method, called empirical robustness. It involves building an efficient python program that ensembles adversarial generation methods and provide a priority-based system in quantifying how vulnerable a model is.

At the end of the internship, students will learn how to build pipelines for adversarial retraining,  understand methods used to generate adversarial examples, and what it means to improve robustness of a deep learning model.

543,20161,Development of a High-Power DC-DC Converter for Aircraft Energy Storage System,"Electrification in the aerospace industry has been going on with the major research and development focusing on more electric aircraft (MEA), hybrid-electric and full-electric propulsions. The MEA concept basically conceives the idea of replacing most of the aircraft secondary systems with electrical systems, offering many potential benefits for the next-generation aircrafts. On modern aircrafts, main engine starter/generators are being used instead of the conventional pneumatic system before starting the main engines. The generators are coupled to power converters that will deliver the electrical power into a common dc bus. An energy storage system (ESS) is required to support the dc bus during peak power demand or during an emergency condition. Therefore, the power converters and ESS play very important roles in the MEA. This project is part of development of an ESS and will focus on building a robust circuit model and control system of a high-power dc-dc converter that governs the power flow from a high-voltage battery to the dc bus or vice versa. The overall model and control system will then be simulated in a real-time platform (hardware-in-the-loop or HIL) to verify the developed control algorithm. Therefore, the student will need to 
1.	learn and understand the available tools required for power converter modelling and HIL verification
2.	follow a model-based design (MBD) approach to generate the necessary code for control algorithm.

The communication and coordination framework for microgrid applications is of utmost importance for multiple reasons. Firstly, the microgrid distributed energy resources (DERs) should also be able to ride-through faults and ensure seamless transition from grid-connected to the islanded mode of operation. Such stringent operating conditions require communication between the controllers of the distributed energy sources. Secondly, communication framework will also play an important role in development of the network protection because the bi-directional power flow in the microgrids necessitates effective coordination among the protection relays.

578,20349,Machine Learning and Data Mining for Automated Policy Generation,"The increased dependence on Information and Communication Technologies in the Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has led to an increase in attack surface. To mitigate the harmful impact of cyberattacks, ADSC researchers have developed a Security Policy Engine to enforce certain rules related to provenance verification of messages, context-aware validation and runtime verification of commands and their trusted execution. These policies are to be enforced in ICS via additional bump-in-the-wire appliances or as a software running on the existing ICS devices. 
In the current state of our Security Policy Engine, whether to impose a certain policy and its implementation details are to be decided upon careful consideration of the cyber risks and operating requirements of the ICS. However, manual selection of policies is time-consuming, prone to human error and does not scale well with the complexity of ICS. This project will build a practical framework to automate the process of generating the rules of the Security Policy Engine. The framework will use operational data and network traces to automatically produce a set of rules and optimize the verification/validation parameters to find the optimum balance between security and performance. To demonstrate feasibility, the developed framework will be tested in a state-of-the-art smart grid testbed.

The successful candidate will assist the team on:
-	Research activities and discussions on data mining and machine learning techniques.
-	Developing solutions to automate policy generation for ICS.

581,20355,Development of a Message Prediction Mechanism for Smart Grid,"Industrial control systems (ICS) are critical for the essential services of our modern society. The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in ICS makes it more intelligent hence provides efficient, seamless, and automated operation. For instance, in smart power grids, an interconnected network of intelligent sensors, energy generation, storage, and load devices can collect and exchange data to maintain
grid-wide situational awareness and to balance demand/response. This increased reliance on ICT brings security challenges that need to be addressed. In Trustworthy and Secure Cyber-Plexus (TSCP) project, we identify and solve research problems related to cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, with high scientific and economic impact. Our work scope also includes the implementation and commercialization of the solutions we invent.

Attacks against industrial control systems (ICS) often exploit the insufficiency of authentication mechanisms in ICS. Verifying whether the received messages are intact and issued by legitimate sources can prevent false data injection by illegitimate devices. However, the key challenge is to introduce message authentication with minimal delay (e,g., some commands in smart grids need to be delivered within 2 milliseconds, ruling out public-key based cryptography) and communication overhead in a variety of ICS communication settings including
multi-cast. In this project, we exploit the predictability of ICS messages to develop a novel multicast message authentication scheme.

In this internship project, the successful candidate will develop techniques to predict future messages using both traditional statistical approaches as well as machine learning techniques. 

The tasks will include,
-	Exploration of machine learning techniques/technologies to predict possible ICS messages and their relative probabilities.
-	Implementation of the techniques and their integration to enhance the efficiency of our authentication protocols by incorporating accurate prediction mechanisms into our
  product.

Our work scope also includes the implementation and commercialization of the solutions we invent.

An increasing number of ICS, including those used for electric substation automation and high-frequency trading, rely on low-latency (e.g., less than 2 ms), high-throughput (e.g., thousands of messages per
second), and secure exchange of data. It is a tall order to employ digital signatures for such traffic, especially under the computing power limitation of prevailing hardware.
Mainstream solutions either use precomputation techniques to reduce the delay of generating digital signatures or employ symmetric key cryptography such as MAC instead. The former's throughput suffers from high computation overhead before the message is given and its verification delay after the message is given is still long, while the latter lacks important security features such as non-repudiation, impersonation-resistance among a group. In this project we develop a digital signature scheme which, unlike existing solutions, leverages small message size to achieve lower
end-to-end delay and higher message rate.

In this project, the successful candidate will develop software for network security and resilience solutions, invented by ADSC researchers. 

The tasks will include,
- Implementation of digital signature schemes developed in-house as well as designing embedded systems with Zynq Systems on Chips. Zynq has an ARM-based processor with the hardware programmability of an FPGA. This task will consist of,
    - Implementation of a novel authenticated data structure,

585,20370,"Software Implementation of Cryptographic Protocols for Secure, Collaborative Storage","Singapore is undertaking the modernization of power grid systems towards “Grid 2.0”. One of the main pillars of Grid 2.0 is the integration of diversified entities of energy generation and storage, known as distributed energy resources (DERs), such as batteries and renewable generators (e.g., solar, wind) that are either at utility scale or consumer level. Furthermore, we are now witnessing strong trends towards deregulation and decentralization in energy markets and renewable energy penetration in other parts of the globe, including the US, China, and Europe.
The distributed, multi-organizational nature of the DER and flexible consumer infrastructures pose a number of security challenges to ensure reliable and trustworthy power grid operation. In this project, we will approach the Grid 2.0 security challenges in Singapore from three angles; secure energy transactions, secure decentralized storage for collaboration, and secure end-to-end communication for resource monitoring and control. Our solution will be a crucial steppingstone towards securing the future’s Grid, hence facilitating renewable penetration for decarbonization, decentralization, and deregulation not only for Singapore’s smart nation but also for expansion to overseas markets.

High accuracy sequences help us find relevant information about the sequenced organism (i.e., human or virus) which is especially important for clinical use. This project will focus on one, important sub-task of genome sequencing, named basecalling. As the DNA strand passes through the nanopore, a few nucleobases create a characteristic current disruption in the pore. A sequencing device continuously measures electrical current and stores it for sequence decoding. The process of sequence decoding from the measured current is called basecalling. The focus of this project will be on developing high accuracy basecaller using deep learning methods. The student will get to know the practical approaches to data preparation and deep learning (such as attention networks and transformers). The solution will be implemented using Python and PyTorch library. The student will be encouraged to publish his application on GitHub as an open-source project.

Project 2: Modification of DNA nucleotides is an important way to control the function of the genome through the regulation of gene expression. DNA modifications contribute to diseases such as cancer where it is used as a biomarker, and it has been found to have influence on aging, demonstrating the value of epigenomics data to understand the profile of each individual patient.
The goal of this project would be to develop deep learning models for the detection of the modification from sequencing data. Initial models would be based on convolutional neural networks. Still, at later stages of the project, other approaches would be tried out as well – such as attention models that recently made a breakthrough in the field of natural language processing and proved to be more successful in language tasks then recurrent neural networks.

Project 3: Genome assembly cannot be feasible without algorithms and methods integrated into tools called de novo assemblers which reconstruct genomes from short sequenced DNA fragments in a manner similar to puzzle solving. The “power horse” of de novo assembly are algorithms on strings and graphs. The majority of de novo assemblers were designed on smaller genomes and work well on larger eukaryotic organisms, but most of them create haploid representations of the genome regardless of the ploidy (they collapse information from their parents). The separation of genetic material from each parent results in knowledge of the complete genotype – all variant forms of all genes. Therefore, different methods should be applied in the assembly process to achieve better reconstructions. The main goal of this thesis is to adapt Raven, a de novo assembler for long erroneous sequencing data, for diploid organisms sequenced. Raven is a tool produced by our group and now is one of the most popular de novo assemblers.

738,20853,ISG - Development of Renovation System,"One of the important aspects of HDB’s work lies in the management and maintenance of over 1 million flats. Part of this involves regulating the renovation works that take place in HDB flats to ensure that homeowners do not compromise the safety and engineering integrity of the supporting infrastructure during their home renovation works. To do this well, homeowners are required to engage contractors that are approved by HDB, and also apply for relevant renovation permits before proceeding with specific alteration works such as electrical extension/installation, and air-conditioning installation.

The processes of applying to be a Registered Contractor, submitting renovation applications, and the entire workflow from the evaluation of applications through to their approval have long been supported by an in-house developed application – Building Addition & Alteration System (BAAS). This application was built on Java EE and has been running on HDB’s on-premise datacentre since inception.

This internship project involves being attached to a Scrum team that is in charge of developing the new Renovation System that would serve to eventually replace BAAS. The Renovation System would be designed with a cloud-native architecture, leveraging serverless runtimes and containers as much as possible to afford higher degrees of scalability. The effort also aims to migrate the workflow into a microservice architecture supported by a lighter-weight Python/NodeJS/React stack.

Interns on this project are expected to fulfil the role as a Developer on the team, working with the Product Owner, ScrumMaster, and fellow Developers in delivering features of the Renovation System in an iterative fashion. They would have the chance to:

•	Experience what it is like working in a Scrum team;
•	Be exposed to DevSecOps practices and culture;
•	Learn about cloud-native design and application development; and
•	Have hands-on experience leveraging CI/CD tools for development automation.

However, the high prediction accuracy often comes at the expense of huge set of deep learning model parameters, large memory storage and high computational costs, which limits the direct deployment of these deep learning models on Internet-Of-Thing (IOT) edge computing devices with limited computing resources.

In this project, the intern will get involved in designing  lightweight yet accurate deep learning based vehicle and pedestrian detectors for next generation smart transportation applications. Deep neural network pruning technique will be employed to further reduce the computational complexity of the deep learning models without compromising the detection accuracy. The developed methods will be deployed on an edge device and field trial will be conducted inside NTU campus with real-life data to validate the proposed solution.

791,20980,Robust & lightweight vehicle tracking,"Edge Computing Platforms allow for on-site processing of the video data to realize real time, low cost and scalable solutions for traffic monitoring and surveillance. An example use case of such a solution is intelligent traffic lights at intersections: video feeds from traffic surveillance cameras is processed on-site to detect the presence of road users such as public buses or pedestrians and dynamically adjust traffic light timings in real-time. However, algorithms that achieve high accuracy for detection and tracking of road users, are also computationally complex and not suitable for the typically resource-constrained Edge Computing Platforms. 

In this project, a vehicle tracking pipeline will be developed that dynamically combines computer vision algorithms for detection and tracking with varying complexity based on scene conditions. For instance, low-complexity algorithms for detection (such as foreground detection) will be employed for light traffic conditions and more complex deep learning-based object detectors will be invoked only when necessary - e.g., in the presence of merges, or when new objects appear at frame boundaries. The pipeline will be developed using the widely adopted OpenCV library and evaluated on extensive video data collected from the NTU campus. It will be tested and optimised on state-of-the-art Edge Computing Platforms.   ",Cyber Security Research Centre @ NTU,"61 Nanyang Drive, #ABN-01b-14, Academic Building North, 637335, SINGAPORE",1,Please ensure that you attach a copy of your C.V. with your application.,"Prerequisites/Requirements:

820,21095,Digital Data Analysis Improvement Project_JTDDA,"Modern manufacturing is no longer just about finding ways to operate faster while reducing expenses; it is also about doing so in a data-driven and intelligent way. With technologies such as cloud and data analytics, the vast quantities of data generated can be processed and translated into actionable insights to diagnose problems and identify opportunities for improvement. With machine learning, highly intelligent systems can assist the workforce in optimising processes, predicting equipment failures and changes in demand patterns. At their best, these intelligent systems can also autonomously make decisions and respond to changing internal and external business needs. 

An opportunity exists to enhance performance monitoring through development of interactive digital dashboards to trend key performance indicators (KPIs). Performance dashboards are used extensively during Tier review meetings; data displayed focuses on high level KPI’s for Tier 4 meetings, with associated drill-down data relevant to specific functions required at the lower level Tiers. It is therefore critical that dashboards offer a high level of connectivity and adaptability to enable their use across the tier meeting requirements.

The site goals are to “Improve the yield efficiency campaign over campaign”, to “improve cost of goods”, and to “make GSK a great place to work”.

As we drive in this direction and to assist the site achieve these goals, Data Platform and Data Intelligent Services platform were built by the IT and Advanced Manufacturing Technologies teams. These platforms are managed and used by IT, Data Engineers, Data Scientists/Analysts and intended to be accessible and user-friendly to the site employees so they can perform their own process investigations. 

Project scope:
For this project, you will be supporting the data scientists and working within the Data Analytics team to structure and manage historical operational data in a way that will help to build predictive models to solve pharmaceutical manufacturing problems. You will help compiling findings and recommendations into reports. You will need to have some basic skill set in using Python and / or Matlab (SQL is a plus).

You will also be using solution such as Power BI or other dashboarding tools to visualize new dashboard and / or migrating of existing dashboards to Power platform. You will incorporate the real-time monitoring & data analytics and upgrade these to obtain maximum benefit. All site KPI boards are in scope of digitalisation, including development of drill down screens to enhance inter tier data connectivity, adapted for functional needs and including integrated, automated data collection and analysis.

868,21183,Using Blockchain for Better Security,"1. Background: We are a tech innovation unit within a larger public security community passionate about creating software products that leverage the latest cloud and blockchain technologies to bring about digital transformation to better secure Singapore.

2. Objective: The technology in blockchain along with its intrinsic properties of being an incorruptible ledger provides us with the opportunity and potential to develop and deploy more secure distributed applications (dApps), that will open new discovery opportunities and drive innovation for the public security community.

Learning Points for Intern:
Guided by an experienced mentor, you will learn to design, develop, secure and test the fast-evolving blockchain cloud apps using micro-service architecture. You will learn to build automated unit test cases, to package and deploy software that are compact and flexible to continuously integrate and deliver new features to the users rapidly in a modern cloud platforms. By taking multiple small steps in an agile way, you can achieve the desired project outcomes that may seem daunting and challenging to you in the beginning. You will be assigned to work in one or more of the following projects:

- Digital ID Wallet: With the increase in popularity and complexity of web services, it is becoming ever more difficult to manage our digital identities. Currently, there is an over-reliance on existing centralised systems which are inherently prone to intrusions and insider attacks. We are exploring alternative digital identity management systems, which return control to the identity bearers and provide more convenient authentication processes compared to current day solutions. In this project, you will be working on distributed identity management systems as well as user authentication protocols to provide users easy access to our blockchain based dApps.

- Decentralised Social Media: Current centralised social media providers act as an intermediary between the users on their respective platforms. Besides collecting an overwhelming amount of private data for advertising revenues, they also have access to the users' uploaded photos, data and messages (potentially to their benefits), leaving users with little control over their own data. Hence, blockchain is introduced, to by-pass untrusted third party intermediaries and rogue insider admins. In this project, you will be working on such truly peer-to-peer social media dApp

- Asset Tokenisation: The growing popularity of Asset Tokenisation bridges the gap between traditional and newer financial markets. Real life tangible and intangible assets can be converted into digital tokens governed by smart contracts that exist across a distributed, decentralised blockchain network. The smart contract controls the execution of transactions which are trackable and verifiable. In this project, you will be working on self-executing smart contracts binded with the terms of the agreements of transactions being written into lines of code. 

Knowledge/Skills Preferred: To set you up for success, we will revise and walk-through with you the prerequisite skills and knowledge during the on-boarding stage.
- Fluent in the essential front-end web development languages, i.e., HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
- Practical hands-on experience in at least one web development framework, preferably React, Node and Typescript.
- Familiar with agile software engineering practices and test-driven development processes, such as UML design and unit testing

1065,21693,IoT data analytics for Singapore Cyberspace,"Internet of Things (IoTs) are growing at a staggering rate and is expected to surge from 8.4 billion in 2017 to 75 billion by 2025. Given the increasing proliferation of IoT devices, coupled with the poor provision of cybersecurity safeguards, it has given rise to increasing cybersecurity concerns and challenges. The crippling of US internet infrastructure by DDoS attack from the infamous MIRAI botnet in 2016, was the starting point when policymakers worldwide realised the extent of the problem of insecure IoT devices. Compromised IoT devices (e.g. cameras) were so rampant that collectively as a botnet, they managed to bring to bear a record of 1.2 Tbps DDoS attack on Dyn (a US-based DNS provider), thus crippling access to essential websites like Amazon, CNN and Twitter. 

With increasing digitalisation of businesses and consumer adoption of smart IoT devices, there is growing concern in this unregulated area, which is facing increasing threats. If this is left unmonitored, there may be an increased risk of a large-scale attack on our national IT infrastructure. More importantly, as a well-connected country with good digital infrastructure, we could be leveraged upon as a botnet platform to attack other countries. This could affect our reputation as a global secure IT and business hub. 

Hence, IoT data analytics is needed to provide CSA with information and analysis of the global as well as Singapore IoT threat landscape. These insights will allow CSA and other Government agencies to put in place policy and technical measures to safeguard the cybersecurity of IoT devices and address the threats before they cause damage.

Project details/job scope: On-cloud large-scale genomics web-services development 
The ever-increasing ease of genomic information acquisition is fostering a new era for data driven clinical practice and health care: Precision Medicine (PM). The A*STAR Genome Research Informatics & Data Science Platform (GRIDS) aims to develop the institutional and computational infrastructures addressing the challenges that arise from the processing of these massive multimodal biological and clinical datasets. We are developing and deploying on public cloud (mostly AWS, but also occasionally GCP and Azure) typical big data analytics stacks (K8s, Spark, ElasticSearch, Juptyer) to compute & visualize trillions of data points (>10,000 genomes x ~3 billion data point per genome).

•            Development of APIs (ElasticSearch / graphQL)  

Project 2: Optimizing and Extending the BANKSY Spatially Regularized Clustering Algorithm
Project details/job scope:
Over the past decade, clustering algorithms have been a major tool for identifying different types of cells within genomics datasets. With the advent of ""spatial""-omics technologies--which track the positions of objects in physical space in addition to the more traditional gene expression feature space--within genomics, there is a need to generalize machine learning methods to incorporate this spatial information. Recently, we developed 'BANKSY', a clustering algorithm that uses a spatial kernel to perform spatially regularized clustering, and in doing so, dramatically improves clustering performance. 

We are looking for a highly motivated student to work on improving the algorithm in multiple directions. Firstly, the student will optimize its python implementation to match its theoretical computational complexity, and incorporate multi-threaded parallelism into this implementation. Next, we will test the performance of the algorithm on different types of datasets and look at the possibility of integrating it with feature selection and data integration algorithms. Finally, if time permits, we will study the possibility of a deeper integration between the graph based clustering and the spatial kernel computation aspects of the algorithm. 
We will also welcome applications from candidates from the School of Art, Design and Media, with the project description above modified to focus on the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of the BANSKY software, along with developing beautiful demonstrations of the technology. 

Project 3: Improving pathology models using spatially-resolved transcriptome measurements
Project details/job scope:
The prediction of clinical and molecular phenotypes from whole slide images (WSIs) of tissue sections is of great interest for applications in diagnosis and prognosis. Advances in deep learning have greatly improved the performance of models trained to directly predict phenotypes of interest from WSIs. More recently, studies have shown that training on auxiliary tasks even under weak supervision (for e.g. training to predict bulk gene expression collected from a whole tissue sample) can further improve performance and interpretability of these models. At the same time, new technologies are now available for measuring gene expression at higher spatial resolution i.e. of much smaller subsections of the tissue. The goals of this project are to 1) investigate if models trained on bulk gene expression of whole tissue samples generalize to new spatially resolved measurements, 2) investigate if fine-tuning models on spatially resolved measurements improves prediction and interpretation of bulk gene expression/clinical phenotypes. Skills needed: familiarity with python, experience with deep learning libraries (pytorch, tensorflow), some existing knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, computer vision.

Project 4: Hierarchical deconvolution of spatially aggregated measurements
Project details/job scope:
New technologies in spatial transcriptomics now enable us to collect spatially-resolved measurements of gene expression within a tissue. However, current commercial technologies have not yet reached single-cell resolution, and so multiple cells might contribute to the measurement at a given spatial location. There is hence a need for algorithms that are able to accurately deconvolve these measurements into cell-type compositions. Current methods for deconvolution are not aware of natural cell-type hierarchies that users may wish to enforce. This project will extend existing algorithms in the space to take into account user-specified cell type hierarchies. Skills needed: familiarity with python, some knowledge of linear algebra and numerical methods (hierarchical non-negative matrix factorization) 

Project 5: Scaling single-cell clustering to millions of cells
Project details/job scope:
Collecting single-cell RNA-sequencing data of millions of cells is becoming increasingly routine. However, common steps in the analysis pipeline of these datasets, in particular clustering, do not scale well without access to large compute clusters. Others have tried to address this challenge via sketching algorithms that seek to provide a representative sample of the dataset. Quality of the clustering then depends on the quality of the sampling. This project will investigate if streaming can provide a robust alternative that achieves exact, high-resolution clustering while maintaining a low memory footprint. Skills needed: familiarity with C++/python, some knowledge of graph data structures and algorithms, especially graph clustering.

Project 6: Predicting signaling interactions between cells using spatial genomics data
Project details/job scope:
Cell-to-cell communication is mediated by the interaction of ligands (from sender cells) with receptors (on receiver cells). Current methods for detecting interactions in spatially-resolved transcriptomics data are mostly focused on local (physical) interactions between adjacent cells, where both ligands and receptors are displayed on the cell-surface. However, global regulation requires longer-range communication that is typically mediated by secreted ligands. The diffusion dynamics of each ligand drives a concentration gradient that determines how receiver cells respond. This project will investigate if combining (a) a spatial diffusion model of secreted ligands with respect to their binding partners (i.e. their cognate receptors) and (b) prior knowledge of the downstream target genes of these secreted ligands can identify interacting ligand-receptor pairs. Skills needed: python, some knowledge of hypothesis testing/statistical inference.

Project 7: DUBStepR: speed-up of correlation range computation
Project details/job scope:
DUBStepR (Determining the Underlying Basis using Step-wise Regression) is a feature selection algorithm for cell type identification in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. DUBStepR selects a basis set of strongly correlated genes that maximally explain variation in gene-correlation space, and then expands this basis set to identify the features (genes) that optimize cluster separation.

DUBStepR is based on the concept that DE genes specific to the same cell types would tend to be highly correlated with each other, whereas those specific to distinct cell types are likely to be anti-correlated. In contrast, non-DE genes are likely to be only weakly correlated. We therefore hypothesized that a correlation range score derived from the difference between the strongest positive and strongest negative correlation coefficients of a gene, would be substantially elevated among DE genes. Indeed, we found that the correlation range score was significantly higher for DE genes relative to non-DE genes.

Computing this correlation range score is the rate-limiting step as it involves calculating correlations between all pairs of gene vectors. As part of their undergrad thesis, the student will work on speeding up this approach to significantly reduce the time and memory complexity of the correlation range computation. DUBStepR is written as an R package, and its preprint is currently on bioRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2020.10.07.330563).

Project 8: Efficient large-scale analysis of structural variants in 10K samples from three diverse Asian populations
Project details/job scope: 
Structural variants (SVs) are defined as genomic rearrangements of 50 bp or more and encompass a broad range of mutational classes, namely deletions and duplications (i.e. CNVs), insertions, inversions and translocations [1]. Because of their size and number, they account for most varying bp in the human genome, and have been identified as an important driver of phenotypic changes, including associations with disease [2] and ethnicity [3]. 
Multiple tools exist to perform de novo discovery of SVs from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, which leverage multiple sources of information, namely read depth (e.g. GenomeSTRIP, CNVnator) and paired-end alignment patterns (e.g. Manta, Delly). No single tool can detect all types and sizes of SVs, and specialised tools also exist to better resolve challenging loci (e.g. MELT for transposable elements, ExpansionHunter for tandem repeats) and complex events (e.g. svtk resolve). As a result, analysis workflows for SVs tend to rely on more than one tool, which poses additional challenges for merging, filtering, genotyping candidate events, and running workflows at scale.
The goal of this internship is to build and deploy a production-ready pipeline for the detection of SVs from short-read WGS data, leveraging on expertise from the research team. The pipeline will be designed to run efficiently on cloud, initially on a set of 10K samples, and with a vision to quickly scale beyond that. Useful skills include: 
-	Experience in Python, applied to task automation and data analysis, and version control (git).
-	Familiarity with cloud-compute (AWS), software packages (Docker) and pipelining languages (cwl, nextflow).
-	Familiarity with WGS and analysis of large datasets.
-	Experience designing, deploying and supporting robust software products.
-	Strong communication skills and ability to work as a team.
