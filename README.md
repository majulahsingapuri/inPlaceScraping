# inPlaceScraping

This is some simple python code that pings the content server of the inPlace portal sequentially for job listings that are made available to you as a user. It helps to gather and simplify the data for you so that you do not have to keep browsing pages in the portal, which can be time consuming.

I have only used a subset of the data points available to the user as per my needs but feel free to look at the JSON of one listing and modify the `properties` as per your needs. This might not be the best way to scrape the server as well. You do figure out how to do it in batches rather than visiting each endpoint individually, please create a pull request and I'd be happy to add it in.


### Disclaimer
*This repository is meant as an experiment and that this requires that you have access to the platform as a valid user. I do not condone hacking computer infrastructure that you do not have express permission to hack and I do not take responsibility for any actions taken against you for computer malpractice/misuse.*
